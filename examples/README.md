# Example Programs

This directory contains a number of Haskell programs that can be used to test the compiler. They include:

* **HeapSort.hs**: An implementation of a HeapSort algorithm. It tests
    * Data declarations
    * Basic recursive and non-recurisve functions
    * Functions with custom constructors

* **Lambda.hs**: A program taken from one of hs-to-coq's examples, [Lambda.hs](https://github.com/plclub/hs-to-coq/blob/master/examples/lambda/Lambda.hs). It tests
    * type declarations
    * more complex use of (user-defined) constructors


* **Simple.hs**: A short, simple program inspired by [Learn You a Haskell's example code on typeclasses](https://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses). It tests
    * simple typeclass declaration
    * simple instance declarations of the defined type class
